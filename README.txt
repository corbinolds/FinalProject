Final Project / Final Project - Key to the Kingdom

This final project makes use of shaders (Artemis's dress up and down movement), it also makes use of shaders in the power up.
It makes the wiggle motion and change of colors. We make use of lights by having the white light and a red light being emitted by the power up.
Materials are used on all of the objects in the game to show the colors. 
Flocking and particle systems are used for the enemies and the snow falling from the sky. 
Textures are used with billboarding and the skybox as well as the ground. 

NEW: A description of the file format that your program reads as input
The file should be a csv format and it should be like this File format is: nNumTrees, NumEnemies, windowWidth, windowHeight

NEW: A rough distribution of responsibilities / contributions of each student
Corbin: Shader on dress/ Sound/Lighting/
Vanessa: Lighting/Billboarding/Trees/Enemies/Skybox/Easter Egg 
Nicholas: Base code/Shooting/Collison Detection/Powerup, shader/Flocking
