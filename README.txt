Assignment A7 - To Arms! A Battle is Brewing

    

In this program, Crane tries to avoid all of his enemies which are constantly trying to attack him. He only wins when theyâ€™re all vanquished. If he gets hit by 2 enemies, he loses all health, and falls to his death. If he goes off the screen, he loses all health, and falls to his death.
The only way to defeat them is to pick up the golden cylinder, which allows Crane to attack the balls.




Usage: 
 
Move the camera around Crane by clicking and dragging. Right click and drag to affect zoom. Move Crane with WASD. Vanquish the ball enemies.

    
The user can also press the 'q' or 'ESC' key to quit the program.




Compilation Instructions:
    
Simply navigate to the directory and type 'make.'




Notes:
    
This assignment took me approximately 4 hours to fully finish.

The lab helped immensely; I used it as a base for this assignment.

Very fun, 8/10.
